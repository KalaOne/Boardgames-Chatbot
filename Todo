    1.1) General information
    1.2) Instructions
    1.3) Reviews

    3.1) detect different types of intent? - Instructions or Reviews or GeneralInformation --- nested if statements

        -- using tags for user intent to detect if they need more information.
        -- "return? " -> user response {TAG}*user_response*

    3.1) Different intents to have differente responses - multi if statements for now

        3.2.2) Clear data from tags and other rubbish
        3.2.3) Based on user intent, return specific data.
