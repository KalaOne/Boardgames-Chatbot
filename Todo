1) Get API call for information about the game
    1.1) General information
    1.2) Instructions
    1.3) Reviews

2) how to?: 
    3.1) detect different types of intent? - Instructions or Reviews or GeneralInformation --- nested if statements
    >> reviews breaks ze code :( [Y]
    >> If update_messages has priority=1, it shows ONLY THAT MESSAGE [Y] - Because of response_required.

    >> favicon not found :/
    >> follow-up on "Anything else?"
        -- using tags for user intent to detect if they need more information.
        -- "return? " -> user response {TAG}*user_response* 

3) Chat
    3.1) Different intents to have differente responses - multi if statements for now
    3.2) Each action to make API call and print out data related to the intent
        3.2.1) Scrape API
        3.2.2) Clear data from tags and other rubbish
        3.2.3) Based on user intent, return specific data.

4) Fix UI because IS UGLEH


UI improvements -> colors on the text of messages - precisely bot responses
